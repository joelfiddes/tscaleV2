TopoSCALE
=========

TopoSCALE is a downscaling tool that uses the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column provided by atmospheric models, together with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs), to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a fine-scale subgrid. The main aim of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model (LSM). Full desciption available in this publication: http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/
